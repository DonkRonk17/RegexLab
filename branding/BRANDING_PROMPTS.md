**Generated:** January 15, 2026  
**System:** Beacon HQ Visual System v1  
**Target:** 3 images (Title Card, Logo Mark, App Icon)

---

## 1. RegexLab - Title Card

**Filename:** `RegexLab_titlecard.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Create a Beacon HQ family title card for RegexLab: Interactive regex tester and pattern library with live matching, common patterns, history tracking, and match export - zero dependencies.

Cinematic 16:9 format (3840×2160). Central logo-style wordmark "RegexLab" integrating regex/pattern matching symbolism (stylized code symbols, pattern recognition grids, text analysis elements).

Background: futuristic eco-tech environment inspired by Beacon HQ, with photonic circuitry lines and premium materials. Minimal, cinematic, ultra-realistic, crisp edges, tasteful glow, no extra text beyond "RegexLab".

Style DNA: Deep glass blues, cool whites, subtle teal glow, natural greens. Micro-etched glass, brushed metal, luminous circuit filaments, clean eco landscaping. Subtle photonic border or corner rails.

Constraints: No watermarks, no random words, no extra logos, no clutter, no cartoon style, no distorted geometry. CPUs are rare accents only (1-3 small embedded motifs max, never the main subject).

## 2. RegexLab - Logo Mark (1:1)

**Filename:** `RegexLab_logo_1x1.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Design a Beacon HQ family logo mark for RegexLab: a simple, high-recognition symbol of regex testing (stylized code brackets, pattern grid, text analysis icon), using Beacon HQ materials and photonic linework.

Clean silhouette, readable at small sizes, optional "RegexLab" wordmark variant below or beside the symbol, no extra text.

Dimensions: Primary 1:1 (2048×2048).

Style DNA: Deep glass blues, cool whites, subtle teal glow. Micro-etched glass, brushed metal, luminous circuit accents. Ultra clean geometric sans typography for "RegexLab" wordmark.

Transparent background. Minimal, premium, instantly recognizable as regex testing tool.
```

## 3. RegexLab - App Icon

**Filename:** `RegexLab_icon.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Create a 1:1 app icon for RegexLab in the Beacon HQ suite style: bold central symbol of regex/pattern matching (stylized brackets with pattern symbol, code icon, text analysis grid), strong contrast, safe margins, minimal detail that still feels premium, photonic accents, eco-tech feel, no text.

Dimensions: 1024×1024 pixels with safe margins for rounded corners.

Style DNA: Deep glass blues, cool whites, subtle teal glow. Single bold symbol representing regex pattern testing. High legibility at small sizes (16px-512px).

Background: Subtle gradient from deep blue to teal from Beacon HQ palette. No transparency needed for icon.
